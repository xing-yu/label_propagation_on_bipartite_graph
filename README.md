# label_propagation_on_bipartite_graph

This is a label propagation algorithm that works on a bipartite graph

The bipartite graph has two kinds of vertices A and B

For A and B, there is both a label (A_labeled, B_labeled) and unlabeled set (A_unlabeled, B_unlabeled).

The possible classes L for A and B are that same.
